Easily learn the purpose and the usage of the flex grid in CSS with a dynamic website.

## ü§î What is this project about?
In this repository, you can see how I built this website, where you can see a visualizer for the flex grid. The purpose is to understand the flex system by actually experimenting with it and see what changes.

The purpose of this project was to experiment with [Vue-Cirrus](https://github.com/FlorianWoelki/vue-cirrus/) and learning more about the flex system.
